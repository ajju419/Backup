A thread is a unit of execution within a process. each process can
have multiple threads. in java every process or application has at least one thread

creating a thread doesn't require as many resources as creating
a process. Every thread created by a process shares the process's
memory and files.

each thread has what's called a thread stack, which is the memory
that only that thread can access.

so every java applications runs as a single process, and each
process can have mutiple threads. every process has a heap and 
every thread has a thread stack.
