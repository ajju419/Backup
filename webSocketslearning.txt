Web Sockets:
------------


first we have to how http protocal is working
when ever a request is raised by the client to the server,
an http connection got created and then the response for the server
will reach the client and reaching the response connection will
automatically closed.....
http protocal is unidirectional.



coming to web sockets they are bidirectional and
the connection will exits either any one client or server
get diconnected example are chat applications

ws://www.google.com
wss://www.google.com

whenever you see the url is in this form you have
to know that they are using web sockets

handshaking starts the websocket connection


in chat and trading applications where we want
to get the updated data then definetly you required
the web Sockets


where we can't use websockets means whenever you
are fetching old data that is already there and
you dont want the updated data then only you
can't use websockets


websoket with spring boot


we have to add websocket dependecy for 
creating websocket in springboot application.
